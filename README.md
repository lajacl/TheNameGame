# TheNameGame
A script that puts a person's name into a famous song.

"The Name Game" is an 1964 American pop song written and performed by Shirley Ellis as a rhyming game that creates variations on a person's name.

The script will not run for a few chosen names that would produce obscene lyrics.

Rules:
Using the name Katie as an example, the song follows this pattern:

Katie, Katie, bo-batie,
Banana-fana fo-fatie
Fee-fy-mo-matie
Katie!
A verse can be created for any name, with X as the name and Y as the name without the first consonant sound (if it begins with a consonant), as follows:

(X), (X), bo-b (Y)
Banana-fana fo-f (Y)
Fee-fy-mo-m (Y)
(X)!
